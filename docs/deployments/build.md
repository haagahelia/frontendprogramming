- So far we have been in the development mode. In the development 
- The following npm command builds your app for the production: 

```bash
npm run build 
````
- The build command creates `dist` folder where minified production version is located. 
- You can run built version locally by using the following command. This command starts local web server and you can access the built version at http://localhost:4173 

```bash
npm run preview
```
