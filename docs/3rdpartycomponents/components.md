- The good news is that you don't have to do everything from the scratch. You can find a lot of third-party components or libraries for React, that are developed and maintained by some developers or organizations.

What you should consider when selecting third-party components:
- Licensing: For example, can you use it for commercial purposes?
- Pricing: Can you use it for free or should you pay?
- Support: What kind of support is available? Is there an active community?
- Documentation: Is a component well documented?
- Development: Is a component still actively developed? You can check component's GitHub repository and see when the last version is released.
