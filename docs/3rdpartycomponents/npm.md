### Npm basics
- When you are using third-party libraries in your React project, you should know how to install these. The installation is done in the project folder using the **npm**. The most of the third-party libraries are published public that anyone can download and use these. 
- The following npm command is used to install libraries or packages to your React project. The command is executed in your project folder using the command line.
```bash
npm install <package-name>
```
- By default, the latest stable version is installed. If needed, you can specify the version number that you want to install.
```bash
npm install <package-name>@1.2.3
```
- Npm is using the semantic version numbering. Read more in npm documentation https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning.
- You can delete the installed package using the following command.
```bash
npm uninstall <package-names>
```
