So far, we have used HTML file for React coding. Now, we start to implement proper React apps.

There are multiple ways to create react app/project, such as:
- Create-React-App
- Vite.js
- Next.js
- Remix
- Gatsby

In this course, we are using **Vite** (https://vitejs.dev/) that is a build tool and web development framework for web applications. Vite.js is really fast and lightweight. That is a good solution for learning React.

Next.js, Remix, and Gatsby are React frameworks that provide a lot of features out of the box.
:::note
Now, we start to use the command line / terminal. If you're not experienced with command line usage, you can refer to online tutorials to help you get started.
