So far, we have been using HTML files for React coding. Now, we will begin implementing proper React applications. Additionally, we have been using JavaScript, but we will now start to use TypeScript. We will start with a quick introduction to TypeScript with React.

:::note
Before starting this chapter, watch the [Why Learn TypeScript?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S96t9kLC5w) video and answer the quiz in the Moodle.

There are multiple ways to create react app/project, such as:
- Create-React-App
- Vite.js
- Next.js
- Remix
- Gatsby

In this course, we are using **Vite** (https://vitejs.dev/) that is a build tool and web development framework for web applications. Vite.js is really fast and lightweight. That is a good solution for learning React.

Next.js, Remix, and Gatsby are React frameworks that provide a lot of features out of the box.
:::note
Now, we start to use the command line / terminal. If you're not experienced with command line usage, you can refer to online tutorials to help you get started.
