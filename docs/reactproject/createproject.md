### Create Vite React project
- Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/) https://vitejs.dev/
- Vite requires Node.js and you can check the latest version requirements from Vite website.
- You can create a new Vite project by entering the following npm command in command line:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
- The command opens a project wizard where you can define a name of your project and framework. Select **React** framework and  **javascript** variant. SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) is a fast JavaScript and TypeScript compiler written in Rust. It is a faster alternative to Babel, which is normally used.

- Next, you change the directory to your project folder and install the dependencies:
```bash
cd your_project
npm install
```
- Finally, run the project in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

:::note
You can stop the process by pressing **q** in the terminal
:::
- Now, you can access the local URL displayed in the terminal using your web browser.
- Vite provides HMR (Hot Module Replacement) which updates the page automatically when you make changes to javascript/typescript or css files.

### Project structure

- Vite creates the following project structure
- The **App.jsx** file contains the React component that is displayed when you open the app in a web browser.
- If you have a bigger app with multiple components and functionalities, it is better to create own folders for them. For example, /components, /api, etc.

- `import` statements are used to import libraries, react components, stylesheet and assets to the component.
- `export` statement allows you to import component to another file by using the `import` statement

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import reactLogo from "./assets/react.svg";
import viteLogo from "/vite.svg";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return <div className="App"></div>;
}

export default App;
```
- The **_main.jsx_** file imports the `App` component and renders it to **_index.html_** fileâ€™s `root` element. The **_index.html_** file can be found from the root folder of your project.

```jsx title="main.jsx"
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import "./index.css";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
:::note
The `React.StrictMode` lets you find common bugs in your React app in the development phase. Due to strict mode, components will re-render extra time in the development mode to find bugs.
