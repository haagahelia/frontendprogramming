- JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Uses declarative way to define the UI and its changes.
- Developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) under the MIT license.
- React is component based and components are reusable. React components are JavaScript functions.
- React documentation: https://react.dev/

React components are like lego blocks from which you can build a user interface. The following UI example consists of three react components:
- Search component (red)
- Table component (blue)
- Table row component (green)

React components build a component tree that now looks the following. **Note!** By default, data only flows in one direction i.e. from top to bottom in the component tree.

### Virtual DOM
The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is an interface for the web document so that scripting languages, such as JavaScript, can access, manipulate, and programmatically interact with the documentâ€™s content. DOM manipulations in web applications are one of the most time consuming operations. React is using **virtual DOM**, that is a lightweight JavaScript presentation of the DOM. It is much faster to update the virtual DOM than the actual DOM. When the UI is changed, React creates a new virtual DOM and compares it to the previous one to find out what changes are necessary to the actual DOM.
