#### React components
React components are like lego blocks from which you can build a user interface. The following UI example consists of four react components:
- Root component (black)
- Search component (red)
- Table component (blue)
- Table row component (green)

#### Component tree
React components build a component tree that now looks the following.

:::note Data Flow 
By default, data only flows in one direction from parent to child component in component tree.

#### Virtual DOM
The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is an interface for the web document so that scripting languages, such as JavaScript, can access, manipulate, and programmatically interact with the documentâ€™s content. DOM manipulations in web applications are one of the most time consuming operations. React is using **virtual DOM**, that is a lightweight JavaScript presentation of the DOM. It is much faster to update the virtual DOM than the actual DOM. When the UI is changed, React creates a new virtual DOM and compares it to the previous one to find out what changes are necessary to the actual DOM.
