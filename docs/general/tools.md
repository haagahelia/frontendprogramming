3. **Git** (https://git-scm.com/)
Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your codebase. We will use Git for version control and to submit assignments.

Other recommended tools:

**Postman** (https://www.postman.com/)
Postman is API testing tool that can be used to development and testing of APIs. In our course, we will use Postman to interact with APIs, send requests, and inspect responses. You can also get Postman extension to VS Code (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Postman.postman-for-vscode).
